## Automated tests written in JavaScript using webdriverIO as framework
This project is set up to help me practice to write automated tests. 
I am using a practice website that has been created for this purpose by community members : 
[Practice Website](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) and source code can be found here
 [GIT](https://github.com/StMarco89/automationpractice.com)
 

##Dependancies

Youâ€™ll need Node.js installed.

Install at least v12.16.1 or higher as this is the oldest active LTS version
Only releases that are or will become an LTS release are officially supported
If you don't have Node installed, recommend installing NVM to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions.


## Run tests local
use npx wdio
